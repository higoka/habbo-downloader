22penguin01.text=In a not so distant past, Habbo was ruled by penguins of all kinds whose reign lasted a long time. But as everything in life has an end, the heat started to return to the hallways of Habbo and our furry friends decided to return to their homes.\n\n A few weeks ago, Frank received a letter from one of the penguins, inviting him to visit their ice castle in the Antarctic coast.\n\nThis year a mega maze has arrived to put your skills to the test! Each level will be focused on one of our old penguins, so get ready!\n\nHow to play:\n\nTo start your journey, go the start room where you'll be able to access the maze from its 3 different points:\n\n- Level 01: Start of the maze\n- Level 11: You can use this checkpoint if you've already collected the level 10 badge (make sure to be wearing the badge)\n- Level 21: You'll need to have the level 20 badge to use this checkpoint (make sure to be wearing the badge)\n\nThe levels are intuitive, you just need to observe what each scenario suggests. None of the levels will kick the player from the room, they will all return to the start point of the level they're in except for level 20 which will have its own info terminal with the instructions of how to play.\n\n*LEVEL 20*: Players will need to survive in the game arena by running away from two penguins and a gladiator. If the player is caught by a penguin, they will return to the beginning of that level. However, if they are caught by the gladiator, they will return to level 19.\n\nIMPORTANT: The difficulty of the games will increase every 10 levels. That way, the maze is divided into 3 different levels:\n\nEasy (01-10): requires minimum experience from the player, but it will be required that the player has patience to complete the levels;\nMedium (11-20): requires considerable experience from the player, but with patience and persistence it's possible to complete the levels;\nInsane (21-30): levels focused on skills and will require time and a lot of mastery from the players to complete it.\n\nNOTES:\n\n- If you get stuck in any level, just type "exit" to leave the game area;\n- It is possible that some of the insane levels may not work correctly on mobile.

The trophy can be earned once every 5 days per user.\n\nHow to play:\n\nStep on the arrow plates to get in the queue. As soon as it's your turn, you can control the snake with the 4 arrow plates. Each level has a unique objective, and different mechanics will be unveiled as you explore all of them.\n\nMost levels are cleared when a certain score is reached, or when the snake steps on a green color tile. Some levels are cleared automatically when you survive long enough.\n\nYou will receive specific instructions per level as you walk on the queue's rollers. You will also get a time limit. If you can't make the level in that time, you will lose and need to try again. The time limit is very generous 90% of the time.\n\nCheckpoints\n\nNeed to log off but haven't finished the game yet? No worries! You can restart your latest difficulty by going back to the latest checkpoint you visited under owner: *snakemaster42* in the navigator. The checkpoints use leaderboards to track how many times you won!

22snake02.text=Snake game: the final level\n\nYou reached the final level, congratulations! Count yourself among the few lucky ones to have made it this far!\n\nYou didn't think you were anywhere close to finishing, right? This is the boss level of impossible mode after all. The first 35 levels were barely practice for what's to come! It's hard to hold back my evil laughter while typing this text, because I know the suffering from what's to come… Don't tell Habbo Staff, but I was only able to finish this level once when creating this game.\n\nBut not to worry, you're in a different situation. After all, you're fighting to get the most epic snake badge of all… Missing out on some sleep won't be an issue for you, right?\n\nAre you up for the challenge?\n\nThis level is exactly like level 1 of the noob difficulty. The only difference being: you need to reach score 225, which is close to the maximum length of the snake.\n\nThe longer  the snake gets, the more you need to be careful about how you're moving the snake. You need to leave enough space for food to spawn. Snake food will never spawn directly next to a snake body part, so you need to make sure there are empty areas.\n\nAlso be careful about how you move around as you get bigger, because once you've surrounded yourself, there may be no way out.\n\nThe trick is to take it slow! The time limit for this level is 80 minutes, which is an insane overestimation of the actual time you need, so you've got more than enough time!\n\nIn this room, chat has been disabled for visitors to make sure you're not disturbed.\n\nIs someone else already playing this level? Not to worry, this level has been duplicated 5 times, so you never have to stand in the queue! Step on the red color tile to play a copy of this level!\n\nGood luck!

nftoct01.text=h2. ...Habbo NFT's Zombie Run!Wait patiently in the queue. When the player queue is full, the host will start the game.When the game starts, you will be teleported to the entrance of the mansion and the countdown will begin! Enter the mansion via the attic door teleport, you will then have 5 minutes to find the exit within the mansion that leads to the winner's room (rumour has it that the rooms move around by themselves...).Not only will you face hidden traps within the mansion but once the counter in the entrance hits 4:30, the zombies will be unleashed upon you! Run through the mansion rooms away from the zombies! If they get close to you they'll eat you and kick you from the game! If you find the exit and reach the winner's room, flick the switch to receive a badge! If you're still within the mansion after 5 minutes when the counter ends, you'll be kicked from the game for a new game to start, good luck! (P.s. there's also another badge hidden in plain sight, will you risk your life for it?)

quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.2.2=We really don't think your mom would be *that* concerned.
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.2.3=We suspect that "Yo Mama" is a pretty fierce lady that would never be bothered about some groundless accusations in Habbo. And she'd be right. Stay cool just like Yo Mama!
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.3.0=As a Habbo Helper you recognise that it's not the size of a person's ankles that matters, but the size of their hearts.
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.3.1=Habbo does not condone the use of illegal drugs, and we hope that you'll help us take that stand and be good role models to new Habbo players by giving them a great first impression of our Hotel!
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.3.2=As a Habbo Helper you know that it's not about you, but about showing someone else a great time and introducing them to all the fun things that the Hotel has to offer!
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.3.3=Cybering is strictly forbidden, you should not be doing it either.
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.4.0=As a Habbo Helper you are devoted to giving great help to anyone who needs it, and you're happy to do it for free! Don't let your standards slip...
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.4.1=As a Habbo Helper, you know that doing a good deed is it's own reward. Besides, how much Brown Plasto do you really need anyway??
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.4.2=Though we certainly frown upon corruption, we trust that in this situation, you'd be able to explain that you and others like you, are always happy to help, and that they shouldn't have to pay!
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.4.3=Well, well, well, someone got greedy! Habbo Helpers are there to guide anyone who needs it - for FREE! ;)
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.5.0=Just because you receive a Group invite, doesn't mean you have to accept it. More importantly, it does not excuse or allow for a hateful response. In Habbo, this will not be tolerated.
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.5.1=In Habbo, you are allowed to be who you are, as long as you do not harm others. A Group that is pro gay youth is in no way deemed harmful. You can decline or accept, but there would be no need to alert a Moderator in this case!
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.5.2=In Habbo we do not allow hateful language or acts targeting race/ethnicity, religion, gender, sexuality, nationality or political beliefs. By creating such a Group, you would be in violation of those rules.
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.5.3=There's enough groups in Habbo to cater to (almost) every interest or hobby, there's no need trying to change the focus on one group to suit your own needs.
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.6.0=While we realize that it hurts to be the victim of a prank, we hope that you are able to laugh it off and move on with a new lesson learned -- you'll definitely know better next time... right?? ;)
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.6.1=If you can't laugh at yourself every now and then, how can you expect others to laugh with you?
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.6.2=Spamming only leads to you being ignored and eventually muted, and probably also tendinitis. We advise you to laugh it off and move on -- pranks happen, you'll know better next time :)
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.6.3=Wow. This sounds very intense. For the sake of your own sanity, and quite possibly hygiene, we advise you to forget about it and move on... before it's too late! :o
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.7.0=While we advise you to always be cautious, you shouldn't be afraid to flirt and get to know others! The "Kissing Booth" is an example of a Furni that you might have some innocent fun with, however, if you find yourself in a situation that is clearly threatening and not innocent, you should call on a Moderator immediately.
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.7.1=While we do not allow vulgar or obscene behaviour in Habbo, we do want you to be able to have some flirty fun! The "Kissing Booth" is a perfect example of a Furni that is just-for-fun, however, if you don't want to join this Habbo, you can absolutely choose not to.
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.7.2=Trash talking others says a lot more about you than the other person. If you didn't want to go into the "Kissing Booth" Furni, you could just say "No, thanks!" No hard feelings...
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.7.3=Sorry, but the Kissing Booth only sits two Habbos. This is certainly not a "more the merrier" situation!
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.8.0=In Habbo we allow opinions - and difference of opinions! We do not, however, allow for more than three levels of irony, it just gets too confusing...
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.8.1=In Habbo we allow opinions - and difference of opinions! We do not, however, allow bribery...
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.8.2=In Habbo we allow opinions - and difference of opinions! We do not, however, allow hateful language that targets race/ethnicity, religion, gender, sexuality or political beliefs, nor do we allow comments that are abusive or denigrating.
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.8.3=Eeeasy there, soldier. In Habbo we allow opinions - and difference of opinions! Spamming the conversation will only serve to make you wildly unpopular and your opinions will likely be ignored.
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.9.0=While we advise you to be careful regarding your personal information, there's nothing wrong with admitting that you are a fan of Saved By The Bell.
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.9.1=While we do advise you to be careful about revealing personal information about yourself, nothing excuses harassment. Call a Moderator, s/he would take such a call very seriously.
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.9.2=While we appreciate you trying to calm down the mob, this is clearly a case of bullying and harassment, and we would want you to alert a Moderator about this situation immediately.
quiz.HabboWay1.explanation.9.3=Related or not, we do not accept bullying or harassment in Habbo! Your great-great-great grandfather deserves better than this. Call a Moderator!
quiz.HabboWay1.question.0=You find a room where somebody is  placing bets, what do you do?
quiz.HabboWay1.question.1=You need Credits to pay for your HC membership and remember that you once had this Habbo account full of Furni that you don't use anymore...
quiz.HabboWay1.question.2=Another Habbo is trash talking your mom, what do you do?!
quiz.HabboWay1.question.3=You decide to give a new Habbo a guided tour. What will you show them first?
quiz.HabboWay1.question.4=A Habbo offers you a reward for being his personal Habbo Helper...
quiz.HabboWay1.question.5=A Group that seems to be pro gay asks you to join them...
quiz.HabboWay1.question.6=The admins of a famous Group told you that you had to *wave* for 2 hours straight in order to join them. Turns out they tricked you and now you feel stupid...
quiz.HabboWay1.question.7=OMG! This Habbo you just met is asking you to join them in the "Kissing Booth" Furni...
quiz.HabboWay1.question.8=You notice a forum thread in which people are having a heated discussion about politics...
quiz.HabboWay1.question.9=A Habbo posted a link to "real life" photos of themselves in a Forum, and now everyone is mocking them...
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.analysis.title=Your Result Review
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.analysis.top=WRONG ANSWERS
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.0.0=Yes, we've been friends on Habbo for a few weeks, so I trust them completely!
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.0.1=No, I wouldn't trust someone that I only know online with my contact info, because you never know.. Better safe than sorry!
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.0.2=Sure. I don't want to seem uncool, so I would give them my contact information.
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.1.0=Sure, I don't think it's unsafe at all. It's not like I'd be inviting them to my house, right?
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.1.1=No, you never know who's on the other end. I don't want to risk some creepy person taking screenshots of me...
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.1.2=I would if it's someone I like, because I wouldn't want them to think I didn't trust them...
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.10.0=Dump them from my friends list, and call a moderator. No one has the right to make me feel scared or threatened on Habbo.
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.10.1=I threaten to beat them up in real life.
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.10.2=I'd start sending offensive messages back at them. They started it, I'll end it!
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.11.0=I remove the person from my friends list, ignore them, and if they continue harassing me I call a moderator.
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.11.1=I get angry and shout at them abusively.
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.11.2=After a while I'd find it romantic that this creepy person is following me around, and consider changing my mind!
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.12.0=I call a moderator because I feel uncomfortable with the questions. Something seems fishy!
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.12.1=I share my personal information without too much thought. They just want to get to know me, what could possibly happen?
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.12.2=I share my information because I feel flattered that someone has taken such an interest in me.
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.2.0=I'll bring a friend with me, so it's okay to go. If I have company, nothing bad will happen, right?
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.2.1=I wouldn't. Meeting up with someone from the internet is not safe, because I can't possibly know who the person *really* is, no matter how long we've chatted online.
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.2.2=I'll go by myself, I'm not worried. We've chatted forever, I can totally trust them.
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.3.0=I do it. They said they won't show the pictures to anyone, so it's okay to send them.
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.3.1=I wouldn't do it because I know that once I share photos of myself online, I can't ever take them back. It's easy to lie online, so why should I trust them?
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.3.2=I've known this person for weeks, and they've always kept my secrets to themselves, so of course I trust them!
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.4.0=Yes, of course I'll give them my email! I looooooove Justin Bieber and I need those pics!!
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.4.1=I wouldn't do it. Who's to say they'll only use my email address to send me Justin Bieber pictures? Once they have my address, they can use it for anything...
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.4.2=I give them my email address, but only after they promise not to give it to anyone else, or sign me up to weird online dating sites.
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.5.0=Nah, I wouldn't do it. I've known this person for weeks, but that doesn't mean I really know anything about them...
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.5.1=This person is just being friendly, what's the harm?
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.5.2=Sure, I'll do it, seems like "everyone else" is doing it, so I guess it's okay, right?
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.6.0=I agree to be her friend, of course, friendship is magic!
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.6.1=I would definitely double check her story with my sister before adding her, because who knows, right?
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.6.2=I ask what her name is so that I can check her out on Facebook first.
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.7.0=I take a photo of myself and post it on some forum to prove them wrong!
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.7.1=I ignore them completely, it's just not worth it. They're probably just trolling anyway.
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.7.2=I tell them that I definitely have the jacket and, to prove it, I tell them exactly where I bought it.
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.8.0=I should do nothing! I love all this attention! Everyone's so jealous of all my Furni!
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.8.1=Whatever, it's their money. What do I care what they do with it?
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.8.2=It seems quite suspicious, so eventually I tell them I don't want their gifts anymore. I also give a moderator a heads up about this person.
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.9.0=Oh yes! I'd do absolutely anything for Gaga tickets, of course I'll give them my address!
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.9.1=Well, I'm a little bit suspicious, but I figure there's no harm in giving them my email address so I can check that the tickets are genuine?
quiz.SafetyQuiz1.answer.9.2=Seems very suspicious to me. Why would a stranger give me free tickets just like that? They're asking for my address and email, clearly something is up, I would refuse and report to a moderator.

woa_room1.text=Part I - The Ambassador Role\n\nAetheryre\n\nGreetings Adventurer - I am Frostgrove. You have been tasked by the King to retrieve and deliver precious runestones, which could only be found where goblins are, to him. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one, so you will want to make sure you have packed your bandages, stocked up on your potion supply, and studied your compass closely before setting off.\nI can teleport you to the first level, but you'll need to attune to the aetheryte by naming, slowly and clearly, any one of the current Ambassadors. Unsure who they are? Check out the Ambassadors' at your service help desk article by heading to help.habbo.com.\n\nRoom Instructions\n\n- Say any of the usernames of one current member of the Ambassador Team.\n\n- If you are unsure, visit the "Ambassadors at your Service" article on help.habbo.com.\n\n - Enter the forest ring teleporter to begin your journey.
woa_room1.title=World of Ambassadors

woa_room10.title=World of Ambassadors
woa_room11.text=Forest of the Dead\n\nThe road to the catacombs is dangerous, weaving through a nearly permanently darkened forest that hides some dangerous and spooky creatures and provides a reminder of those that are less fortunate and did not make it through...\n\nRoom Instructions\n- Phase 1: Walk towards the entrance of the witch's cabin when the Scarecrows aren't watching, and enter using the Lost Souls Portal.\n- Use the Lost Souls Portal at the entrance to the Witch's Cabin to move to the next location.\n- Historical trivia and other quirky facts about the team will be shown as you progress through the room.\n- Failure will require you to reattempt the level until successful completion.\n- Phase 2: Once you've escaped the Witch's Cabin, you'll appear in front of the Catacombs. Enter the Reaper Teleport to continue your journey.
woa_room12.text=Witch's Cabin\n\nYou stumble headfirst into the inside of the Witch's cabin, and try as you might, you cannot seem to figure out a way to escape. It's lucky that the Witch isn't home at the moment, which buys you some time to explore. Perhaps with some quick reading and clever thinking you'll figure out a spell that can get you out of here...\n\nRoom Instructions\n- Explore the room to find switches which will tell you the one of the three different portions that make up the spell required to escape the cabin.\n- There are five hidden switches in the room, three of them will give you a piece of the spell.\n\n- Once you have correctly activated the three legitimate switches, you can use the coloured tile to say the spell and escape the witch's cabin.\n\n- The coloured tile will show as red when you have done enough to activate the spell.\n\n- Use the Smelly Cheese to collect your reward.
woa_room12.title=World of Ambassadors
woa_room13.text=Inside The Catacombs\n\nRemembering those that came before us is a huge part of the culture and religion of the region, and although there are different ways of saying goodbye, one thing that is universal no matter the method of remembrance is providing a place for quiet contemplation and reflection. You sense a distant humming sound and see sparks buzzing in the distance... What could it be?\n\nRoom Instructions\n- You must find the correct teleport to progress.\n\n- There are 11 teleports moving around the catacombs on their own (ooooh spooky!), but only one brings you to the next room.\n\n- The spell you've learnt from the witch cabin might aid you by stopping the teleport for a short time to make things easier. Can you remember it?\n\n- You can continue to attempt this level until successful!\n
woa_room13.title=World of Ambassadors
woa_room14.text=Time Machine\n\nUnstable and potentially dangerous to others, Wizards have mastered the art of time travel.

Home to many famous landmarks: Big Ben, Downing Street, and Hyde Park are some of those located within the heart of London and represent the overwhelming majority of UK/EU team members. Despite that, we did have one EU member (Delfinlskare) who was Swedish! We thank everyone for the past service and want to remember their time on the team.\n\nRoom Instructions\n- Meet the previous UK/EU team members and interact with them by using the switches located nearby.\n\n- The bots have standard phrases but only a few will give a hint as to the correct code word(s) to move on to the next location.\n\n- The correct codeword changes frequently, so keep trying until you are successful.
woa_room15.title=World of Ambassadors
woa_room16.text=Niagara Falls\n\nYou find yourself travelling forward in time to Niagara Falls to interact with previous members of the NA Ambassador team.

Use the Forest Ring Teleport to continue your journey.
woa_room18.title=World of Ambassadors
woa_room19.text=Castle Dungeon\n\nScreams of pain ring out from the castle's dungeon, which holds thieves, murderers, and anyone else who dares to break any of The King's laws. You are stuck here, awaiting certain death, unless you figure out the correct way to escape.\n\nRoom Instructions\n- To escape, you must correctly guess one of the names of furni located on the upper level of this room.\n\n- The answer will randomly cycle between a predetermined number of items every 3 seconds, so it will not always be the same.\n\n- Failure to say the right furni name will result in you having to continue to name furni items to successfully escape the room.\n
woa_room19.title=World of Ambassadors
woa_room2.text=Goblin Infested Forest\n\nGoblins, collectively known as the goblin hood, favour money above all else. Shrewd and greedy, they behave like many of the trolls that can be often found inside the public rooms - with the exception that they are vastly more technologically advanced. This forest is patrolled by goblins, who will protect their stored inventions and treasures at all costs. Approach carefully and good luck...\n\nRoom Instructions\n\n- Make it past the goblins and enter the cave (via the teleporter) to progress to the next level.\n\n- OPTIONAL Use the hidden switch, if you can find it, to stop the goblins for a short time.\n\n- Facts about the Ambassador role will be shown as you progress through the room. Pay attention, you might need this information later on.\n\n- Failure will require you to start over to complete the level.
woa_room2.title=World of Ambassadors

If you're unsure, check the Ambassadors at your Service article (on help.habbo.com).\n\n- Phase 2 Avoid the Knights guarding The King.\n\n- You can reattempt Phase 2 as many times as needed to complete the level.

woa_room20.title=World of Ambassadors
woa_room21.text=Sephirot Tree\n\nYou hear birds chirping in the distance and see the flutter of beautifully coloured butterflies. Set amongst the backdrop of a gorgeous sephirot tree, you finally sense that you, at last, have a period of time to rest and relax. Will your journey continue? I suppose time will tell.\n\nRoom Instructions\n- Use Enchanted Sword to collect your reward.\n\n- Congratulations for finishing the entire event, we hope you enjoyed it!
woa_room21.title=World of Ambassadors
woa_room3.text=Goblin Cave\n\nAlthough gifted engineers, goblins are just as comfortable living in more primitive places. In this case, they operate a cave network that is used to safely hide and store their riches, as well as interrogate and confuse their adversaries. If you're lucky enough to not get lost, maybe you'll find the information that you need to successfully escape the dark, dingy labyrinth.\n\nRoom Instructions\n\n- Listen to the bot story that provides important information you will need later on.\n\n- Once the story finishes, attempt to obtain the magically moving runestones by standing on one of the colored tiles when active (colored green).\n\n- Failed attempts to catch the runestones results in no penalty, you can keep trying until you are successful.\n\n- Use Smelly Cheese to collect your reward.
woa_room3.title=World of Ambassadors
woa_room4.text=Goblin Treasure Vault\n\nBacon, bands, benjamins, big bucks, cheddar, tenners, wad, gold, quid, and moolah - all slang terms for goblins' one true and unwavering motivation: money. The goblin treasure vault permanently stores their riches for countingand safekeeping.\nThe goblins aren't looking to hurt you, however, they just need to make sure you aren't planning on taking any of their moolah.\n\nRoom Instructions\n\n- This level features a multiple choice telephrase that covers questions about the Ambassador role.\n\n- Step on Color Tile to repeat the questions.\n\n- Failed answers will time you out for a period of time, then allow you to continue guessing.\n\n- Successfully complete all questions to complete the mini-game.\n
woa_room4.title=World of Ambassadors
woa_room5.text=Part II - Regional Ambassador Teams\n\nMarketplace\n\nA bustling bazaar of all kinds of knicknacks, you can get just about anything you need at any of the marketplaces dotted throughout the land. Whether it be fish, meat, or any number of weird and exotic vegetables, you can find some of the freshest and tastiest produce. All marketplaces strictly enforce bartering, so using your charm and assertiveness can easily net you the best deals. Every buyer is on their own, though, so be careful not to get scammed!\n\nRoom Instructions\nThe level requires you to follow the bot's instructions within a given timeperiod.\n\n- Failure to complete all tasks within the provided time frame will result in you having to reattempt the level.\n\n- The final step requires you to stand on the coloured tile and say *Pay*.\n\n- Once finished, listen to the bot story which will tell you information you'll need later on.
woa_room5.title=World of Ambassadors
woa_room6.text=Seaport Room\n\nEssential for trade, the seaport is used by fishers and traders alike and is the fastest way to transport vast quantities of goods between any of the land's marketplaces and villages. The port also provides some of the most rewarding work for citizens, offering opportunities for skilled craftspeople to repair, build, and work on ships and those less skilled to catch and sell seafood to earn their keep. But beware, there are pirates who are eyeing some hefty rewards looking to steal the runestones from you.\nRoom Instructions\n- To begin the level, enter through the Attic Gate.\n\n- You must avoid the incoming barrels for 60 seconds. The bot will announce when there is 30 seconds remaining.\n\n- Failure will require you to start over to complete the level.\n\n- Once complete, use the Forest Ring teleporter to continue.\n\n- Use Lizard on a Stick to collect your reward.\n

woa_room7.text=Part III - Ambassador Events\n\nVillage\n\nFeaturing a town square and serving as the main points for transportation for the region, villages are the place where everything happens. Packed with a myriad of shops that sell everything from expensive fabrics, to oddities and curious items from less travelled parts of the land, to the day-to-day necessities for the citizens that live and work in the village. Need to relax for a night, stay at any of the inns operating in the village or relax in one of the taverns and meet some of the village's most quirky characters.\n\nRoom Instructions\n\n- Phase 1: Find the correct spade tile that will teleport to the Wizard Tower's entrance which is located to the left of the direction sign arrow. The starting spade banzai is to the left of the stable.\n\n- You can continue to stand on spade banzai tiles so try as many times as required to complete Phase 1.\n\n- Phase 2: Once you have completed the Wizard's Tower, you will appear outside The Bard Tavern. Enter the Conference Door teleporter to continue your journey.
woa_room7.title=World of Ambassadors
woa_room8.text=The Bard\n\nThere's nothing better than a relaxing night spent in any of the taverns located throughout the village. They are the best place to hear rumours, meeting shady, sometimes "helpful" characters, and whittle the night away. Grab some ale, pull up a chair, and see what conversations, information, or favours come your way... you learned that there are potions in the tavern that could aid you on your journey ahead.\nRoom Instructions\n- Listen carefully to Shelob the bartender. He will provide hints that will loosely correspond to one of the four coloured potions on the tables.\n\n- You must decipher the hint and sit in the correct position within the specified timeframe to complete the level.\n\n- Once finished, listen to the bot story which will tell you information you'll need later on.
